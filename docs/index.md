<div style="border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; background: #fffbeb; padding: 0.9rem 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <strong>Beta Version</strong><br>
  cicd-sensor is currently in beta. Feedback, real-world testing, rule development, and validation in CI/CD environments are very welcome.
</div>

CI/CD Pipelines build, release, and deploy software — and they hold the keys to do it: cloud credentials, signing keys, registry tokens.
That makes them the prize.

Entering 2026, supply chain incidents are accelerating.
Attackers slip *through* trusted CI/CD Pipelines, package dependencies, and container images, run **inside the job**, and disappear with the evidence when the CI/CD Pipeline ends.

Every other runtime has its open-source defender — Falco, Tetragon, Tracee, Wazuh, OSQuery.
CI/CD runtime has nothing.
Sigstore brought us cryptographic proof of *where* and *how* an artifact was built; the next piece — *what actually ran* during the build, what it touched, where it connected — is the runtime evidence defenders still need to detect attacks and respond.

**That is the gap. [cicd-sensor](https://github.com/cicd-sensor/cicd-sensor) is built to close it** — using eBPF inside the CI/CD Pipeline to make runtime visible, detect attacks while they happen, and preserve the evidence teams need to respond.

- **Developers — OSS or commercial — should be able to see what their own pipelines actually do, and prove it later** — process, network, and file activity across build, release, and deploy, plus a verifiable attestation predicate.
- **Security teams — defending against supply chain attacks — need tools built for the runtime** — real-time detection plus the runtime logs they actually need, like Job Result, Detection, and Runtime Telemetry, giving CI/CD the detection, incident response, and forensics environment it has been missing.

## Getting Started

On GitHub-hosted runners, add the cicd-sensor action as the first step in your workflow.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: cicd-sensor/cicd-sensor-action@fe377a3c0c6f1c495d5c11bd940c9cf8e0a9486b # v0.0.2
```

See [GitHub-hosted runner](user-guide/github-hosted.md) for details.
For self-hosted runner fleets or GitLab CI/CD, choose a deployment path from the [User Guide](user-guide/overview.md).

## Key Features

- **eBPF-powered observability**: observes process execution, network connections, and file access at the kernel level.
- **CEL-based rule engine**: monitors CI/CD runtime events with readable, flexible expressions.
- **Correlation detection**: detects combinations of events, such as credential access plus suspicious execution, instead of relying only on single events.
- **Runtime security logs**: provides Job Result Logs, Detection Logs, and Runtime Telemetry Logs for real-time detection, triage, incident response, and forensics.
- **Runtime report and attestation**: generates a graphical report and an in-toto compatible runtime-trace attestation predicate so teams can review and verify CI/CD runtime activity.
- **Centralized management**: cicd-sensor Manager distributes policy, config, and output routing across runner fleets.

## Supported CI/CD Pipelines

cicd-sensor treats GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD as supported targets.
For platform and runner environment status, see [Platform support](user-guide/overview.md#platform-support).
