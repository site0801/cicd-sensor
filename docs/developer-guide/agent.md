# Agent Architecture

The Agent is the central component that connects CI/CD job lifecycle with runtime events.

One agent process runs on one host and can observe multiple CI/CD jobs at the same time.
Kernel-side observation is handled with eBPF. Job lifecycle and rule evaluation are handled in userspace.

This diagram is the reference point for reading the Agent implementation.
`host start`, `project start`, and dockerd proxy staging requests enter the Agent through the Listener over a Unix socket.
JobRegistry issues tracking commands to the Kernel Runtime.
Scope owns rule, summary, and output state, but it does not operate the Kernel Runtime directly.

## Concepts

### Job

A **Job** is one CI/CD job tracked by the Agent. It is identified by the provider-supplied job identity (repository, workflow run, job name, runner) and owns its own cgroup tracking, rule evaluation, scope-local summaries, and outputs. The Agent can run many Jobs at the same time; each Job is finalized independently when its work completes.

The Agent separates job identity from job metadata.
Identity is required to register and track a Job.
Metadata is attached to the Job for logs, reports, and search.

| Category | Fields | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Job identity | `provider`, `provider_host`, `project_path` | Yes | Common provider identity for every Job |
| GitHub identity | `github_run_id`, `github_job`, `github_run_attempt`, `github_runner_tracking_id` | Yes for GitHub Jobs | Identifies a GitHub Actions job run attempt and runner tracking ID |
| GitLab identity | `gitlab_job_id` | Yes for GitLab Jobs | Identifies a GitLab CI job execution |
| Job metadata | `commit_sha`, `ref_name`, `trigger`, `actor_id`, `actor_name`, `github_workflow_ref`, `github_workflow_sha`, `github_workflow`, `gitlab_job_name`, `gitlab_config_ref_uri` | No | Enriches logs, reports, and triage |

### Scope

A **Scope** is the configuration / control surface attached to a Job. Two kinds exist, and a single Job may have one or both:

| Scope | Owner | Where it comes from | Typical setup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Host scope** | Host operator (e.g., the platform team that installs cicd-sensor on the runner host) | `host start` from a runner hook | Self-hosted runners, where the agent is provisioned by infrastructure |
| **Project scope** | Project / repository operator (e.g., the team owning the workflow) | `project start` from the cicd-sensor-action (or equivalent) | GitHub-hosted runners, where each workflow brings its own configuration through the Action |

Each scope carries its own rules, evaluation state, and output destinations. The two are isolated: one scope cannot read or override the other's rules, and their outputs are emitted separately. This lets the host operator and the repository operator each configure cicd-sensor for their own concerns without interfering with each other — the host operator can enforce a baseline across all jobs on the host, while a repository can layer project-specific rules on top.

## Implementation types: Agent, JobRegistry, Job, JobScopeState

The Concepts above are realised by four Go types whose relationship is fixed. Misplacing a field across this boundary breaks the security model, so the structure is load-bearing.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    direction LR
    class Agent {
        +hostManagerConn
        +hostManagerClient
        +socketPath
        +provider
        +runnerType
        +Run()
    }
    class JobRegistry {
        -jobs : map[JobIdentity]*Job
        -kernelTracker
        -baselineLoad
        +ApplyGitHubHostStart()
        +ApplyGitLabHostStart()
        +ApplyProjectStart()
    }
    class Job {
        -identity : JobIdentity
        -metadata : JobMetadata
        -host : *JobScopeState
        -project : *JobScopeState
        -eventCh
    }
    class JobScopeState {
        +Type : ScopeType
        +RuleSets
        +RuleModifiers
        +OutputSettings
        +ResolvedRules
        +Observations
        +ConfigRevision
        +DefaultMaxAlertsPerRule
    }

    Agent "1" --> "1" JobRegistry : owns
    JobRegistry "1" --> "0..*" Job : catalogues
    Job "1" --> "0..1" JobScopeState : host
    Job "1" --> "0..1" JobScopeState : project
    Agent ..> JobRegistry : passes hostManagerClient at start
```

A single agent process holds one `Agent`, one `JobRegistry`, many `Job`s, and up to two `JobScopeState`s per Job: a host one built by `ApplyGitHubHostStart` / `ApplyGitLabHostStart`, and a project one built by `ApplyGitHubProjectStart`. They never read or write each other. Rule actions, including `terminate`, only emit detections; the Job ends through external triggers (Runner termination, cgroup removal).

### Where each type holds state

`Agent` is the **top-level process-wide orchestrator** and the only natural home for dependencies that exist once per agent process — one host scope per process means those dependencies have nowhere else to live.

| Holds | Does not hold |
| --- | --- |
| `hostManagerConn`, `hostManagerClient`, `socketPath`, `provider`, `runnerType`, agent lifecycle (shutdown / drain) | per-scope state, active job map, kernel tracking state |

`JobRegistry` is the **active jobs catalog and KernelTracker binding**. Host-start methods (`ApplyGitHubHostStart`, `ApplyGitLabHostStart`) receive the host manager connection / client as parameters; `JobRegistry` does not hold them as fields.

| Holds | Does not hold |
| --- | --- |
| `jobs` map (active Jobs by identity); KernelTracker binding; baseline loader; in-flight `starting` reservations | manager clients, per-scope `OutputSettings`, result log senders, manager output queues |

`Job` holds **one CI Job's identity, metadata, lifecycle, and event worker**, plus pointers to up to two `JobScopeState`s (host, project). Per-scope config does not become a Job-level field — it lives on the referenced `JobScopeState`.

`JobScopeState` holds **per-scope state for one Job**.

| Holds | Does not hold |
| --- | --- |
| `Type` (host or project), `RuleSets`, `RuleModifiers`, `ConfigRevision`, `OutputSettings`, `ResolvedRules`, `Observations`, `DefaultMaxAlertsPerRule`, scope-local manager job-log routing | state that assumes host and project share it |

If host and project could diverge in the future, the value is scope-local from the start. Equal values today are not a reason to hoist. Shared queues, connection reuse, and similar optimizations come after ownership is clear.

### Naming and configuration flow

Names expose the owner: `host*` for host-owned, `project*` for project-owned, `scope*` (or placement on `JobScopeState`) for scope-local. A wide, owner-free name on a shared struct is the sign of a placement bug.

Configuration flows along the diagram's edges: host config from the host operator (`Agent` → `JobRegistry` host-start → the Job's host `JobScopeState`); project config from a project start request → the Job's project `JobScopeState`. `FetchConfig` results stay within the scope of the client that issued the fetch. The host operator does not override project rules, caps, or output destinations; adversarial project input is bounded by a global hard ceiling.

### Event evaluation is per-Job

Host scope and project scope are separate rule sets, but they normally overlap heavily in practice — both sides typically include the same Baseline rules independently. Evaluating the same compiled rule twice (once per scope) would scale the CEL hot path with the number of scopes for no behavioural gain.

Rule evaluation is therefore done **per Job, not per scope**: `mergeEvaluationRules` de-duplicates rules across the Job's host and project `JobScopeState`s, `NewEvaluationState` compiles the merged set once, and each event is evaluated against that merged set in a single pass by the Job's one event worker. Per-rule `FeedHost` / `FeedProject` flags then route each hit back to the host `JobScopeState`, the project `JobScopeState`, or both. Scope isolation is preserved in the **output routing**, not by duplicating evaluation per scope.

## Subsystems

| Subsystem | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Agent | Top-level orchestrator for Listener, JobRegistry, KernelTracker, and shutdown |
| Listener | Receives start / staging requests over the Unix socket and handles provider routes and peer credentials |
| JobRegistry | Handles job registration, host / project scope attachment, KernelTracker primitive composition, and finalize |
| Jobs / Scope | Handles per-job event workers, rule evaluation, and scope-local summaries / outputs |
| KernelTracker / eBPF Runtime | Handles cgroup / process tracking, kernel sample decoding, and EventRecord attribution |
| Outputs | Holds runtime summaries used as inputs for job logs, project results, reports, and attestations |

## Provider Flow

| Provider | Runner | Start entrypoint | cgroup seed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions | GitHub-hosted runner | `/v1/github/project/start` | cgroup of the project start peer PID |
| GitHub Actions | Self-hosted Machine Runner | `/v1/github/host/start` | cgroup of the hook peer PID |
| GitLab CI/CD | Self-hosted Docker executor | `/v1/gitlab/staging/put` -> lazy `/v1/gitlab/host/start` | Docker label evidence and staging promote |
| GitHub ARC / GitLab Kubernetes executor | Planned | TBD | NRI / Pod metadata and similar options are under consideration |

The agent process selects one provider at startup.
The Listener mounts either `/v1/github/*` or `/v1/gitlab/*`, not both.

## Listener trust model

CI/CD runner hosts are treated as **host-disposable**: a compromised job already has full host-UID access, and isolation between runs is delegated to the layer below (fresh VM / container / per-job host). cicd-sensor follows that model — the runner host is a single trust boundary, not a hardened multi-tenant surface.

The control socket is therefore local-only with mode `0o777`; authorization is at the request layer via `SO_PEERCRED`, not filesystem ACLs.

| Gate | Endpoints | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent-owner | GitLab `host/start`, GitHub / GitLab `staging/put` | peer UID == agent owner |
| Existing Job | GitHub `project/start`, `project/result`, `host/end`, `job/health` | peer PID's cgroup is in a tracked Job |
| None (seed) | GitHub `host/start` | peer's cgroup becomes the new Job's tracked root |

GitHub `host/start` carries no gate by design: the runner hook may not share the agent's UID, and there is no existing Job to validate against. Co-resident untrusted local users on the runner host are out of scope.

## KernelTracker Primitives

Job tracking is expressed by JobRegistry composing KernelTracker primitives.

| Primitive | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `RegisterJob(jobID)` | Creates userspace job state and a per-job event channel. Does not touch BPF maps. |
| `BindProcessCgroupToJob(jobID, pid)` | Resolves the PID cgroup and adds it to `tracked_cgroups`. |
| `StageCgroupBasenameForJob(basename, jobID)` | Stages a Docker cgroup basename. |
| `RemoveJob(jobID)` | Cleans up job state, cgroup bindings, staging entries, and process context. |

`RegisterJob` and cgroup binding are separate operations.
GitHub can resolve the cgroup from the peer PID at start time, so it uses `RegisterJob + BindProcessCgroupToJob`.
GitLab Docker executor registers a job from label identity evidence and waits for a later staging promote.

## Design Notes

- Job membership is determined by cgroup tracking. Process context is a fat node snapshot with `exec_path` / `argv` / `ancestors`; it is not used as the job boundary.
- KernelTracker state is owned exclusively by its loop goroutine. `jobTrackingState` is not published externally.
- Listener stays as the delivery layer. Provider differences are contained in handlers and JobRegistry primitive composition.
- Output runtime is scope-local. Host / project output queues are not hoisted into JobRegistry.
- JobRegistry owns lifecycle. It is not on the hot path for event routing.
