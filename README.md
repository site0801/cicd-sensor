## What cicd-sensor does

**Detection** — Detects supply-chain attacks at runtime using process ancestry (e.g. credential access from a process descended from `npm install`) and correlation across signals (e.g. multiple credential categories read in one job). Baseline rules target patterns seen in real CI/CD attacks.

**Logs and evidence** — Per run, cicd-sensor can emit logs for review, alerting, and forensics, routed through cicd-sensor Manager to cloud sinks like S3, GCS, and Pub/Sub. The cicd-sensor-action can also produce a graphical report and a build attestation per run.

## Quick start

On GitHub-hosted runners, add the cicd-sensor action as the first step in your workflow.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: cicd-sensor/cicd-sensor-action@6ee257338e68af2b279b321b3346fe5f385aa498 # v0.0.29
```

For self-hosted GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD, see the [User Guide](https://cicd-sensor.github.io/user-guide/overview.html).

## Why CI/CD runtime needs this

CI/CD pipelines build, release, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure — and they hold the cloud credentials, signing keys, and registry tokens to do it. Supply-chain attackers run inside those jobs and disappear with the evidence when the job ends.

Most other runtimes have their open-source defenders — Falco, Tetragon, Tracee, Wazuh, OSQuery. Open-source coverage for CI/CD runtime has lagged behind. Sigstore proved *where* and *how* artifacts were built; cicd-sensor preserves *what actually ran* so teams can detect, respond, and audit.

## Supported CI/CD pipelines

| Platform | Environment | Status |

| GitLab CI/CD | Self-hosted Kubernetes executor | Planned |
| GitLab CI/CD | GitLab-hosted runner | Not supported (technical constraints) |

Linux kernel: 5.15 or later on `amd64`, 6.1 or later on `arm64`.

## About the project

> [!NOTE]
> **About the creator** — cicd-sensor is a vendor-neutral open-source project, created and maintained by [Hiroki Suezawa (@rung)](https://www.suezawa.net) — author of the [Common Threat Matrix for CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/rung/threat-matrix-cicd), contributor to the [OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-ci-cd-security-risks/), and early contributor to [OSC&R / pbom.dev](https://pbom.dev/). cicd-sensor was started as an individual project to stay close to the open-source community that is on the receiving end of supply-chain attacks.

A read-only official mirror is published at [gitlab.com/cicd-sensor/cicd-sensor](https://gitlab.com/cicd-sensor/cicd-sensor). GitHub is the canonical source; the GitLab mirror is synced periodically.
