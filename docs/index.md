## What cicd-sensor does

**Detection** — Detects supply-chain attacks at runtime using process ancestry (e.g. credential access from a process descended from `npm install`) and correlation across signals (e.g. multiple credential categories read in one job). Baseline rules target patterns seen in real CI/CD attacks.

**Logs and evidence** — Per run, cicd-sensor can emit logs for review, alerting, and forensics, routed through cicd-sensor Manager to cloud sinks like S3, GCS, and Pub/Sub. The cicd-sensor-action can also produce a graphical report and a build attestation per run. Your data stays under your control — cicd-sensor never sends anything to servers operated by the cicd-sensor project.

## Getting Started

On GitHub-hosted runners, add the cicd-sensor action as the first step in your workflow.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: cicd-sensor/cicd-sensor-action@6ee257338e68af2b279b321b3346fe5f385aa498 # v0.0.29
```

See [GitHub-hosted runner](user-guide/github-hosted.md) for details.
For self-hosted runner fleets or GitLab CI/CD, choose a deployment path from the [User Guide](user-guide/overview.md).

## Why CI/CD runtime needs this

CI/CD pipelines build, release, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure — and they hold the cloud credentials, signing keys, and registry tokens to do it. Supply-chain attackers run inside those jobs and disappear with the evidence when the job ends.

Most other runtimes have their open-source defenders — Falco, Tetragon, Tracee, Wazuh, OSQuery. Open-source coverage for CI/CD runtime has lagged behind. Sigstore proved *where* and *how* artifacts were built; cicd-sensor preserves *what actually ran* so teams can detect, respond, and audit.

## Supported CI/CD Pipelines

cicd-sensor treats GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD as supported targets.
It works on both public and private repositories, with no third-party SaaS dependency.
